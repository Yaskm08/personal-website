          If I needed to describe myself in a single sentence or phrase, I would
          say <b>life long learner</b>. Above all other descriptions or
          qualities I might claim to have, the non-stop pursuit of knowledge and
          new skills is by far the most important and is the quality I am most
          sure of.
